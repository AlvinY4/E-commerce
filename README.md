## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Description 

This backend application is a mysql database for a e-commerce site, achived using Mysql, Express, Sequelize, and Dotenv. While building this application I did run into some trouble with Mysql, It did not want to work with my username and password but managed to resolve the problem by creating a new one. The database can be reached through Insomnia, unfourtunately I was not able to get the GET request for categories to work, the api just does not want to load for me. Other then categories, everything works perfectly which is presented in my demo video below.
